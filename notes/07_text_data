CHAPTER 07 - WORKING WITH TEXT DATA
------------------------------------------------------

- In particular for text classification tasks such as spam and fraud detection or sentiment
    analysis, bag-of-words representations provide a simple and powerful solution.


- As is often the case in machine learning, the representation of the data is key in NLP
    applications, and inspecting the tokens and n-grams that are extracted can give powerful
    insight into the modeling process.


- In text-processing applications, it is often possible to introspect models in a meaningful
    way, for both supervised and unsupervised tasks.  You should take full advantage of
    this ability when using NLP-based methods in practice.


- Natural language and text processing is a large research field.  If you want to learn more:

    - Natural Language Processing with Python by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, 
        which provides an overview of NLP together with an introduction to the nltk Python package 
        for NLP

    - The more conceptual book is the standard reference Introduction to Information Retrieval by 
        Christopher Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Sch√ºtze, which describes fundamental 
        algorithms in information retrieval, NLP, and machine learning


- As we discussed earlier, the classes 'CountVectorizer' and 'TfidfVectorizer' only implement 
    relatively simple text-processing methods. For more advanced text-processing methods, we 
    recommend the Python packages:

    - spacy (a relatively new but very efficient and well-designed package)

    - nltk (a very well-established and complete but somewhat dated library)

    - gensim (an NLP package with an emphasis on topic modeling)
