    "One of the main disadvantages of using a bag-of-words representation is that word order is completely discarded. Therefore, the two strings “it’s bad, not good at all” and “it’s good, not bad at all” have exactly the same representation, even though the meanings are inverted. Putting “not” in front of a word is only one example (if an extreme one) of how context matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a way of capturing context when using a bag-of-words representation, by not only considering the counts of single tokens, but also the counts of pairs or triplets of tokens that appear next to each other. Pairs of tokens are known as *bigrams*, triplets of tokens are known as *trigrams*, and more generally sequences of tokens are known as *n-grams*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the range of tokens that are considered as features by changing the *ngram_range* parameter of *CountVectorizer* or *TfidfVectorizer*. The *ngram_range* parameter is a tuple, consisting of the minimum length and the maximum length of the sequences of tokens that are considered. \n",
