    "Now that we know how to evaluate how well a model generalizes, we can take the next step and improve the model’s generalization performance by tuning its parameters. We discussed the parameter settings of many of the algorithms in scikit-learn in Chapters 2 and 3, and it is important to understand what the parameters mean before trying to adjust them. Finding the values of the important parameters of a model (the ones that provide the best generalization performance) is a tricky task, but necessary for almost all models and datasets. \n",

    "Because it is such a common task, there are standard methods in scikit-learn to help you with it. The most commonly used method is grid search, which basically means trying all possible combinations of the parameters of interest."

    "Consider the case of a kernel SVM with an RBF (radial basis function) kernel, as implemented in the *SVC* class. As we discussed in Chapter 2, there are two important parameters: the kernel bandwidth, *gamma*, and the regularization parameter, *C*. \n",

    "Say we want to try the values 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 for the parameter C, and the same for gamma. Because we have six different settings for C and gamma that we want to try, we have 36 combinations of parameters in total. Looking at all possible combinations creates a table (or grid) of parameter settings for the SVM, as shown here:"
