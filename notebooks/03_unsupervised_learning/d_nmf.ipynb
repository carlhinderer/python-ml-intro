    "*Non-negative matrix factorization* is another unsupervised learning algorithm that aims to extract useful features. It works similarly to PCA and can also be used for dimensionality reduction. As in PCA, we are trying to write each data point as a weighted sum of some components. \n",
    "\n",
    "But whereas in PCA we wanted components that were orthogonal and that explained as much variance of the data as possible, in NMF, we want the components and the coefficients to be non-negative; that is, we want both the components and the coefficients to be greater than or equal to zero. Consequently, this method can only be applied to data where each feature is non-negative, as a non-negative sum of non-negative components cannot become negative."

    "The process of decomposing data into a non-negative weighted sum is particularly helpful for data that is created as the addition (or overlay) of several independent sources, such as an audio track of multiple people speaking, or music with many instruments. In these situations, NMF can identify the original components that make up the combined data. Overall, NMF leads to more interpretable components than PCA, as negative components and coefficients can lead to hard-to-interpret cancellation effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenfaces, for example, contain both positive and negative parts, and as we mentioned in the description of PCA, the sign is actually arbitrary. Before we apply NMF to the face dataset, letâ€™s briefly revisit the synthetic data."
